				<h1>About Me</h1>

				<img id="bio-image" class="img-size" src="https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p160x160/12936620_10154071200262641_299787109184203196_n.jpg?oh=2140cc18ce27a4f5b316977b4f35fe03&oe=5930559D " alt="Matt Daul" class="about-me-pic"/>

				<p>I’m up to something. You smart, you loyal, you a genius. Surround yourself with angels. The key to success is to keep your head above the water, never give up. You see the hedges, how I got it shaped up? It’s important to shape up your hedges, it’s like getting a haircut, stay fresh. Stay focused. We don’t see them, we will never see them. Mogul talk. To succeed you must believe. When you believe, you will succeed.</p>

				<p>Special cloth alert. The key to more success is to get a massage once a week, very important, major key, cloth talk. Mogul talk. Bless up. The first of the month is coming, we have to get money, we have no choice. It cost money to eat and they don’t want you to eat. To succeed you must believe. When you believe, you will succeed. You should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life, we breathing, we blessed. They will try to close the door on you, just open it. They never said winning was easy. Some people can’t handle success, I can.</p>
